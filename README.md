# FordInternshipCodingExercise

This repository contains the coding exercise for 2021 Ford Motor Credit Company- Software Engineering Intern position.
I chose to do Exercise Choice 2: Mustang Bronco GUI

Taken from the provided PDF:

Program a user interface that accepts an integer from the use and displays a string value based
on the following algorithm:

1. If the number is divisible by 3, display “Mustang”.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, display “Bronco”.
3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, display “MustangBronco”
4. For all other numbers, display the number itself.

I coded this exercise with Java and on eclipse as my IED.
